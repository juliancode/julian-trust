		    			<p>The Julian Trust started life in 1986 when a small group of concerned individuals felt there was a need to do something for those who were sleeping on the city streets of Bristol in doorways, derelict buildings, cemeteries, and car-park stairwells to name just a few of the uncomfortable and unsafe locations. They decided that an emergency Night Shelter was needed to provide the first rung on the ladder out of homelessness.</p>

		    			Volunteers and money were required. So the news spread, mainly by word of mouth, and the public responded. But nothing could happen until a building could be found from which the Night Shelter could operate. By September 1986 the organisation had been granted charitable status and the Catholic church of St Nicholas of Tolentino generously offered one of their annex buildings in Pennywell Road as a temporary base. The Night Shelter opened its doors to its first guests on 26th September and there it stayed in cramped conditions for over a year until December 1987.

		    			In December 1987 the Church of England made available the hall and other rooms within St. Thomas Church near Bristol Bridge. This provided a larger dormitory, a better kitchen and sleeping quarters for volunteers in the bell tower! At the same time another new charity, Caring at Christmas, was formed by members of the Julian Trust and other interested individuals. Together, the first Christmas Shelter was opened offering 24-hour provision for five days. The Night Shelter stayed at St Thomas’ for the next two years, finally moving in April 1990.

		    			In April 1990 the Bristol Bus Company kindly offered its empty offices and garage workshop in Marlborough Street near the bus station for our use. This move provided better facilities yet again with much more room to organise. But first the deep bus inspection pits had to be filled in with tons of sand—the volunteers who helped on that weekend will never forget it! The Night Shelter was based here for just over two years until July 1992.

		    			In July 1992 the Night Shelter moved to Dean Street. For the first time rent had to be paid! It was now clear that the Night Shelter itself was really without a long-term home of its own, moving every two years into buildings that were not entirely suitable for its purposes. Furthermore, needing to ask the public for donations to pay a commercial rent was not the best use of their money. Could they instead be asked to fund a real home for the Night Shelter? It would need to be purpose-designed to have all the best features of our previous buildings and to meet Bristol City Council planning requirements. So began the Bristol Night Shelter Project.
